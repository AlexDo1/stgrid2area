        """
        Wrapper function to aggregate the spatiotemporal grid to the area's geometry using either the exact_extract or xarray method.  
        Usually, you first perform the `clip` and then aggregate the clipped stgrid. Using the clipped
        raster data also results in much faster aggregation.  
        The aggregation is spatially (e.g. the spatial mean), so the time dimension is preserved and
        the result is a time series DataFrame with the same time dimension as the input grid.

        method yields weighted spatial statistics based on the fraction of the pixel that is covered by the geometry,
        while the xarray method yields unweighted spatial statistics based on the pixel values. As weighted
        statistics are only possible with spatial dimensions >= (2, 2), the exact_extract method will raise an error
        if the spatial dimensions are 1 in at least one direction. In this case, the xarray method can be used as a fallback.
